## Notes
- PicoCli runs each command in a separate thread
- a command has to implement runnable or callable 
  - every command line tool returns an exit status to communicate success or failure 
  - success is 0 and failure is a non-zero value 
- Help option can be autogenerated by `mixinStandardHelpOptions = true`
- `requiredOptionMarker='*'` show required options in help
- mapdb is a java library to save collections to the file system
